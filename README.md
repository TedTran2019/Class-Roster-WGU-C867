# WGU-C867
I'll be writing the program in Ruby, then recreate it in C++ as I learn the language. 

Tools used for C++: clang-format, clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror, leaks --atExit -- ./program

- Replaced vector solution with dumb array of object pointers one to meet rubric
- Didn't bother including output screenshots in Github repo
